# Python To-Do List Using File Handling and CUI

A to-do list is a useful application that lets you manage your tasks and mark them as done when you finish them. To make a Python to-do list using file handling and CUI, you will need to:

- Create a text file to store your tasks
- Use the `sys` module to handle command-line arguments
- Use the `datetime` module to record the date and time of each task
- Define functions to add, delete, complete, and show your tasks
- Use file I/O operations to read and write your tasks to the text file
- Use conditional statements and loops to handle different user inputs and errors
